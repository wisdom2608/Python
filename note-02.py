# ==============================================================================================
# Run your first python program. With this piece of code, you can print your name on the screen.
# ==============================================================================================
print("wisdom python")

# How to draw a dog

print("0----")
print(" ||||")
# Description: What we have understand in the codes above is that python codes get executed line by line from the top.
# ...we saw python enterpreter, that is the program that knows how to translate or interpret a python code into....
# ...instructions that a computer can understand. 

# ======================================
# How to multiply a string by any number
# ======================================
 
print("*" * 10)

# Description: Aywhere we have quotations "" or '', we are defining a string. A string is a programming term which means...
# ...which means a series of characters. So, "Wisdom python", "0----",  " ||||", "*", are all strings.
# ("*" * 10), means we are multiplying the string "*" by number, 10. The asterek is the multiplication operator just like the ...
# ...operator we have in math.  With this piece of code, ("*" * 10), we call draw 10 astereks on the terminal.
# What we have <"*" * 10>, on the the piece of code, print("*" * 10) is called an expression. An expression is a piece of code that ...
# ... produces a value. So, when python interpreter wants to print a code, it evaluates the code we put in the parenthesis. 
#  Here, ten astereks will be printed on the terminal..


# =================
#       Variables 
# =================
price = 10 
print(price)
# Description: Variables in python are one of the most fondamental concepts in programming, specifically to python.
# We use variables to temporary store data in a computer's memory in binaries (a serie of 1s, and 0s).
# when python interpreter executes this code, it will allocate some memory that will store a number, 10 in that memory.
# Finally, it will attach the label "price" in that memory location. Imagine we have a box numbered 10, and "price" is the label we put..
#.. in the box. We can use the labe everywhere in the program to access the value that we have in that box.
# To print the value of the variable, we type <print(price)> without quotation in the parenthesis. This because we want to print a variable, "price".
# This will print the number, 10 on our terminal.

# ===================================
#   Update the value of Variable
# ===================================

price = 10 
price = 20
print(price)

# Description: If we reset it to a new value like 20. When we run the program, we should see 20.
# Remember, python interpreter execute a code line by line from the top.

# ====================================================
#  Variables With Integers and Floating Point Numbers
# ===================================================
price  = 10 
rating = 4.9
print(price)

# Description: The numbers 10 in the piece of code above is called integer. It is a number without a decimal point. we can also use number...
# with decimal point such as 4.9, 2.5, etc, they are called floating point numbers.

# ===================================================
#  Variable With String, And Variable With Boolean
# ====================================================
name = "Wisdom"
is_published = True 
is_in_school = False
print(name)
print(is_published)
print(is_in_school)

# Description: We can also define a variable and set it to a string. For instance name ="Wisdom"
# A boolean can be <True>, or <False> but not like "Yes" and "No" in English Language. We use underscore(_) to separate
#..multiple words in a variable's name. For instance "is_published". The False and True are called boolean values.
# NB: Python is case-sensitive language which is sensitive to lowercase and uppercase letters. So, also use lowercase letters when defining variables.
# But the boolean True, and False are special key words in python language. So pyth will not understand it when spell "true" istead of "True", or "false" instead of "False"
# Summary: This exercise we are storing simple values in a computer's memory. Simple values can be numers (such as integers, floats), string, and booleans.

# In python we can also store complex values like <lists>, and <objects>.


# Proof Concept: Imagine we want to write a program for a hospital. So, we check in a patient named Wisdom Faith. He's 20 years old and is a new patient
# Work Required
# Define:
# - three variables for his name, his age and another variable to tell if it's a new and existing patient.

#          Solution
name = "Wisdom Faith"
age = 20
is_new =True



# ===================================
# How to Receive input from the user
# ===================================
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hi " + name)
# Description: We going to write a small program that asks the username and then will print a greeting message customized for that user.
# So, instead of <print>, we will use <input>. Both these <input>, and <print> are functions that built into python. As a matter of fact, think of the remote control..
#...of your TV. On this device, we have a bunch of bottons. These bottons are function built into your TV. You can turn it on, turn it of, change channel, reduce the volume, etc.
# In python we also have a bunch of functions for common task such printing message, receiving inputs, and so on. We are going to use the <input> function and whenever we have..
# ...parenthesis, it's like recalling what executes that function. It's like princing a botton on a remote control. 
# Let's call an <input> and in between parenthesis we are going add a string, enabling it to print something on the terminal. ie input("What is your name? ").
# This contains a question mark (?), followed by a space. That is, input("What is your name? ")
# Ths <input> function will print the message < What is your name? > on the terminal and will wait for the user to enter a value. Whatever the user enters, the <input> function will return.
# We can get that value and store it in a memory using a variable. So get the result and store it in variable called name.

# On the second line of our code we want to print a message like "Hi Wisdom Faith!". To do this we type print("Hi ") with a space and after the quotation, we...
#... want to dynamically print what we have in the < name variable >. That is print("Hi " + name)
