# How to use loops
#==================

#What is a loop? A loop allows you to execute a block of code multiple times. Every sing week my wife comes to me and say ...
#... wisdom "can you take out the trash?" and she asks me that every single week. in this sense it's aloop. Let's create the loop
# There are two types of loop in python:
# - a < for loop >
# - a < while loop >

# a < while loop >
x=0
while(x<5):
    print(x)
    x=x+1
# a < while loop >
for x in range(5,10):
    print(x)
    
# Other things we can do with loops
days = ["Mon","Tues","Wed","Thur", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"] # We've a variable "days" and array asigned to it.
for d in days:
    print(d)

# Let's apply some logic. Here, we want to know all the days before "Thur"
days = ["Mon","Tues","Wed","Thur", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"] 
for d in days:
    if(d=="Thur"):break # Stops the listing at wednesday
    print(d)
    
# If we want to continue after Thurs
days = ["Mon","Tues","Wed","Thur", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"] 
for d in days:
    if(d=="Thur"):continue
    print(d)
    
# All the foundation knowledge we've learn has been building our own code. However we can build on top of what others have done
#..using libraries and modules. There are a lot of fantastic labraries that we can use. Let's say we want to print out the value of <Pi>
#... we can turn out to an existing library called "math".
